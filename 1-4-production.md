# 1.4 Production

Most journals with small production staff combine copyediting and layout into one stage. In many cases, it is the editor herself who does this work.

After downloding the draft file from the *Copyediting* stage and performing copyediting and layout, simply upload the final PDF file to the *Galleys* section of the production stage.

Click **Add galley** and enter a label for the galley file. This could be something like *PDF* or *Full Text*. This label appears on the article download button in the table of contents.

Next, select the *Article Component* for which you are uploading a galley. Then click the **Upload File** button to choose the final PDF.



Click **Continue**.

Confirm the details and click **Continue**. Finally, click **Complete** to upload the article galley.
