# 2.2 Responding to a Review
Once the review process has completed, you will be notified via email by the editor of their decision.

After receiving the email, login to your dashboard.

From here, you can see the decision (revisions requested) and a link to the editor's notification.

Based on the information in the editor's message, you must now prepare your revisions.

## Uploading the Revised File

By scrolling down the page, you will find a panel for **Revisions**.

At this point, the author needs to wait to hear back from the editor as to whether the revisions are acceptable.

##Revisions Accepted

You will receive an email that your revisions have been accepted.

In addition, notifications will appear on your dashboard.
